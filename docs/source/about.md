# Daily Organisation

The daily work is organized in sprints that are reviewed during daily SCRUM sessions.

We use [Github](https://github.com) issues for tasks and sprint tracking. This allows us to have a single place for code developement and tasks follow-up.
Read how to [master issues on Github](https://guides.github.com/features/issues)

In addition to the default labels:

- **bug**: when we spot a bug;
- **duplicate**: when some other issue already address the current issue;
- **enhancement**: when we have an idea we want to discuss about;
- **help wanted**: when we are stuck and know that someone else can help;
- **invalid**: when it does not make sense;
- **question**: when we have a question;

We use the following ones as well:

- **task**: to assign tasks;
- **feedback needed**: when we need feedback on something;
- **link**: to share a link or something interesting;
- **FYI**: just to notify the others about something.

Please discuss with your manager for

+ The time for your daily SCRUM.
+ The holiday. Agree and confirm by email. Don't forget to 
mention it during the SCRUM meetings.
+ Your middle-term target with your KPI.
+ Target day for your OpenSource Day (don't forget to update the Google calendar and everyone during the SCRUM meeting on this).
